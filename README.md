This project works with the dataset of a supermarket which includes sales, customer segment, region, product details like product-id,name, price. Also it include shipment details and order details like order_id, customer name, quantity purchased, profit on that sale etc. This data has been taken from kaggle and through this dataset we would like to give some key business insights and suggestions to supermarket owners as to how they can increase their profit by targeting right customer base and with right products. With this analysis we will also give a idea of premium membership which will increase their loyal customer base.
